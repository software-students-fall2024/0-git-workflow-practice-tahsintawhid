# An Essay That Is Very Insightful

I found this [essay](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) from Paul Graham, one of the co-founders of Y Combinator. Y Combinator has invested in some of the biggest companies we know today, including Airbnb, Doordash, Dropbox, Reddit, Stripe, and Twitch. Graham, who's also a software engineer himself, had previously created a company that was bought by Yahoo a little before 2000. This essay is important because it touches upon many things that we often overlook when working on something. Having a focus on the intricacies of the details we'll come across, and paying attention to our craft will help us not only become better software engineers, but also to build better and more purposeful software as well.
