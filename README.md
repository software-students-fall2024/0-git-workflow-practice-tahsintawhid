# An Essay That Is Very Insightful

I found this [essay](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) from Paul Graham, one of the co-founders of Y Combinator. Y Combinator has invested in some of the biggest companies we know today, including Airbnb, Doordash, Dropbox, Reddit, Stripe, and Twitch. Graham, who's also a software engineer himself, had previously created a company that was bought by Yahoo a little before 2000. This essay is important because it touches upon many things that we often overlook when working on something. Having a focus on the intricacies of the details we'll come across, and paying attention to our craft will help us not only become better software engineers, but also to build better and more purposeful software as well.

I found this article to be very insightful. In particular, I loved the idea that the best way to discover important problems to work on is to immerse yourself in fields you're genuinely curious about and let your mind wander, rather than trying to force a solution or pursue trendy areas. This insight of letting the mind wander is particularly powerful, as I've found that many great ideas seem to come this way.
